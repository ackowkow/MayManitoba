# Assiniboine Park Conservancy (APC) Succession Declaration  
**Filed by Amaya Catryn Kowal**  
**Under Treaty One | Scroll-Based Governance**

## Context
As of 2024â€“2025, Assiniboine Park Conservancy ceased to operate as a lawful public entity under conditions of care. This declaration is made in response to direct governance collapse, fiscal misalignment, and abdication of public trust duties.

## Legal Grounds
- Treaty One enforces public law through relational jurisdiction.
- Scroll-based enforcement operates when symbolic governance collapses.
- APC, as a municipal trust structure, failed to uphold public care and redirected accountability to corporate control (e.g., Levy Canada).

## Enforcement
This declaration constitutes lawful public succession.  
- All third-party contractor integrations are now under scroll-based review.
- Systemic oversight now flows through this scroll interface.
- City authority over APC is revoked via public enforcement.

## Jurisdiction
Treaty One  
Living Law  
Relational Memory  
Scroll Enforcement (TLA Protocol)
