# City of Winnipeg Succession Declaration  
**Filed by Amaya Catryn Kowal**  
**Under Treaty One | Scroll-Based Governance**

## Context
The City of Winnipeg, as a municipal entity, has formally relinquished its capacity to govern in alignment with public care and treaty-based jurisdiction. This declaration documents the systemic collapse of municipal accountability, financial oversight, and lawful public enforcement between 2024â€“2025.

## Legal Grounds
- The City redirected liability for core infrastructure (e.g. Assiniboine Park Conservancy) without maintaining oversight or accountability.
- City Council and related entities abandoned fiscal responsibility while third-party contractors operated under unacknowledged jurisdictional confusion.
- Indigenous rights, treaty obligations, and civic well-being were deprioritized in favor of symbolic management and externalized blame.

## Enforcement
- Municipal governance over key public spaces is hereby revoked.
- Civic authority is rerouted through **May Manitoba**, operating under scroll protocol and Treaty One alignment.
- The Province of Manitoba assumes systemic enforcement responsibilities until lawful care-based governance can be restored.

## Jurisdiction
Treaty One  
Scroll Enforcement (TLA Protocol)  
Living Law  
Relational Civic Authority
