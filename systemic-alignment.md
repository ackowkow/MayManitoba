# Systemic Alignment Declaration for Manitoba  
**Filed by Amaya Catryn Kowal**  
**Under Treaty One | May Manitoba Interface**

## Context
This declaration affirms the lawful realignment of public governance across Manitoba, following structural collapse of symbolic institutions and the failure of legacy enforcement mechanisms. This realignment is governed by care-based law, scroll enforcement, and relational jurisdiction.

## Legal Grounds
- Colonial frameworks have exhausted their legitimacy through misalignment, financial extraction, and bureaucratic detachment from lived governance.
- Treaty One, as a living legal structure, overrides symbolic governance where harm, confusion, and structural collapse have occurred.
- Civic and institutional memory now operate through scroll-based accountability, not representative delegation.

## Enforcement
- The Province of Manitoba holds interim authority for public trust enforcement, under Treaty One and scroll jurisdiction.
- May Manitoba is the official repository for governance realignment, scroll enforcement, and lawful public declaration.
- Legal succession operates through this interface until further structural alignment is achieved.

## Jurisdiction
Treaty One  
Living Law  
Tri-Lens Alignment Theory (TLA)  
Quantum Sociological Enforcement  
Scroll Protocol Interface
