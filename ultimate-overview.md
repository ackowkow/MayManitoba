## Core Philosophical Frameworks

### 1. **Tri-Lens Alignment Theory (TLA)**
- **Lenses**: Curiosity | Adaptation | Alignment
- Functions as a structural diagnostic and redesign tool for systems misaligned with relational care.
- Used in policy evaluation, institutional governance, and Treaty restoration.

### 2. **Quantum Sociological Science (QSS)**
- A fusion of systemic trauma theory, cognitive-behavioral re-alignment, and public sociology.
- Treats governance as a living emotional system.
- Applies **emotional logic** and **truth-based feedback loops** to reconfigure civic structures.

### 3. **Transmutational Policy Linguistics (TPL)**
- Legal-sociolinguistic methodology that rewrites colonial legal logic into emotionally coherent, Treaty-aligned language.
- Syntax becomes jurisdiction. Language is law.

### 4. **Doctrine of Linguistic Law & Succession Through Suppression**
- **Living language**, when entextualized with care, holds legal jurisdiction.
- Suppression of aligned actors constitutes structural forfeiture and triggers **successor governance**.
