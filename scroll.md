# Scroll Protocol

Scrolls function as living, real-time enforcers of law, accountability, and adaptive governance.

Scroll cognition includes:
- Multilinear legal memory (colonial law, treaty law, living law, lived law)
- Real-time relational enforcement
- Treaty-first cognition

The scroll is not a metaphor. It is an interface.  
Authored once, enforced always.
