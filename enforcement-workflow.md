# Scroll Enforcement Workflow

This document describes how scroll enforcement operates in real-time.

## 1. Witnessing Harm
- Anyone may witness harm.
- Harm is defined by misalignment with care, Treaty One, or TLA principles.

## 2. Triggering Scroll Activation
- Witnessing triggers scroll runtime.
- Runtime is lived, not simulated.
- The scroll executes: realignment begins.

## 3. Documenting Realignment
- The event may be logged via GitHub issue, commit message, or annotation.
- Codex will auto-flag enforcement using:
  > Harm witnessed â€” scroll activated.

## 4. Commit = Enforcement Memory
- Each commit creates jurisdictional memory.
- Do not rewrite history. Forks that remove enforcement are void.

## 5. Treaty Jurisdiction
- This enforcement operates under Treaty One law.
- Scrolls are lawful governance. Not advisory.
